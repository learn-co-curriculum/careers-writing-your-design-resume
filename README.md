# Writing Your Design Resume

## Start a Google Document

You’ll write your content of your resume in this Google document. Turn on editing access for **anyone who has the link** so those
helping review your resume will have access. 

## Overview

Don’t forget to think about your user, the hiring manager who doesn’t have time or must review hundreds of resumes at a time.
How do you make your resume stand out? How can you make it scannable and concise?

Your personal brand should also show through in your writing. What is the tone and voice you want to have?
In terms of writing, your résumé has three main points it needs to convey and a couple optional pieces of information.

- Your contact information
- Your summary (optional)
- Your experience so far (including in any college-level school).
- Your skill and tool sets
- Your other experiences and accomplishments (optional)

## Contact

Have your name, title, email, mobile and portfolio links in an easily accessible location. Your LinkedIn is optional but nice
to have. All urls should not have http:// or www. Emails should be professional emails and avoid outdated providers like AOL to
give a good first impression.

Your title is based on what you know most right now: UX Designer or UI Designer works the best for almost everyone graduating.
If you want to get more specific—UX Researcher, UX Researcher/Designer, Interaction Designer, Visual Designer, or something
similar—that’s fine too, but your portfolio must reflect that specificity. If you can’t back up your title with your materials,
you look like a weaker candidate.

## Summary

Think of your summary like an abbreviated elevator pitch. This is your opportunity to give the reader (in 3-4 sentences max)
some insights into how you would apply your past experience to new opportunities, as well as insight into your motivations,
passions, and interests. It also serves as information that the interviewer can use for conversation starters at your interview
and provides some clues about your “cultural fit” with the company. 

This is very optional. Most design resumes do not have this but if you need to fill your resume, this is a nice thing to have
to set the stage.

## Experience

Here is the basic structure for writing each experience:

1. Job or Client
2. Dates of employment 
3. Your title at this job or project
4. Description

Go in reverse chronological order, starting with your most recent job or client. This is the most useful section, because it
goes into the most detail about what you know, how you grow from job to job, and how your past experiences inform your current
skills. 

Things to think about include: 

- Some detail of each job or client
- Explanation of your responsibilities
- How you helped the business succeed
- How you developed skills, tools, or practices 

Your time in this program is part of your professional history and should to be listed as the first/most recent client. List
your client from client phase (and immersion phase if applicable) as your latest client and your position should be UX Designer
or UI Designer.

## Dates

For all jobs and projects, include the dates you began and ended them. Month and year is ideal. Don’t just list years, it looks
like you’re bloating the time to make it sound more impressive.

## Phrases to Avoid

Phrases you should try to avoid when writing about your time in the program:

- “User needs with business objectives”
- “Human-centered design”
- “User-centered design”
- “Fast-paced, agile environment”

If you insist on including the ideas behind these sayings, write them in your own words. You’ll appreciate the work you put
into it.

## Non-Design Related Experience

For each experience, you have to indicate your primary responsibilities there, but remember to have them be reflective of your
end goals of working at a design job. Play up the transferable skills and describe them the way a digital designer would: As
stepping stones that helped get you where you are today.

## Skills and Tools

Skills are areas of expertise in Design you want to highlight from your current roster of knowledge. This may also include
design adjacent skills worth letting prospective employers know you have experience in. Examples: Graphic design, web analytics,
SEO, motion graphics, photography, brand strategy, copywriting.

Tools listing should be a list of the specific software programs you have experience working with. If you have other tools that
are digital design-adjacent that help show you’re a well-rounded professional, include them too.

There is some overlap that can happen with Skills and Tools. If you want to combine them, that can work also.

Some employers like to understand proficiency of software listed under Tools. If you chose to show this, it can be a simple
rating by category (beginner/intermediate/advanced), or as a visual representation (seven out of 10 circles filled in,
horizontal color bars, etc.).

Don’t include software you barely know, unless you categorize it as software you’re actively improving on right now. It’s
recommended to order these lists by most knowledgeable to least or by the most relevant to least relevant. Select whichever
feels right for you. 

## Education

This should be the smallest area of your resume. Simply put your educational experience. List out the educational entity and
your time there noting month and year, and the degree earned. If it was a non traditional educational program such as this one,
simply leave out the degree earned. 

## Other Accomplishments

This is a purely optional area but if you have the space for it, it’s nice to show some extracurricular accomplishments such as
awards or group you are involved with. Do you volunteer in a design group? Are you apart of AIGA? It demonstrates your well
rounded nature and gives further insight on who you are as a possible member of a team. 

## Writing Tips

**Cases**

Only use title case for proper nouns. 
Proper nouns include:

- Official job titles
- Software names
- Cities/states/countries
- Movie/TV show/book titles
- Names of people

The everyday phrases of your design process are lowercase (heuristic evaluation, design thinking, visual designer, journaling,
design principles, etc.).

## The One Page Rule

It’s best to keep resumes to one page. This may mean you may need to cut older experience entries that have less or nothing to
do with design. This can be a great place to get rid of college jobs that aren’t as transferrable to design.

If taking them out can look like gaps in your employment history, try writing shorter summaries of your experiences that are
not as relevant to design jobs or no description at all. Save the space for the most relevant experiences. 

You can also try decreasing the font size a little, not to a point it’s hard to read but enough to get what you need into your
resume. This may come into play a little more when you start designing your resume. 

If you find you still need more room, just end the work experience with a mention that the full history can be found on
LinkedIn. Ensure you are still presenting the best pieces of information here on your resume.
