# Writing Your Design Resume

## Start a Google Document

You’ll write your content of your resume in this Google document. Turn on editing access for those helping to review your resume.

## What to Include

Remember to pull in your design education and think about your user: the hiring manager who is short on time and must review sometimes hundreds of resumes at a time. How can you make it scannable and concise? How do you make your resume stand out? Your personal brand should show through in your writing as well as in the design. What is the tone and voice you want to have?

When composing your resume ensure these main areas are communicated:

* Your contact information
* Your summary (optional)
* Your work experience
* Your skills and toolsets
* Your education (if applicable) 
* Other experiences and accomplishments (optional)

## Contact

Have your name, title, email, mobile and portfolio links in an easily accessible location. Your LinkedIn is optional but has become a standard. All URLs can have the http:// or www removed for simplicity. Emails should be professional emails and avoid outdated providers like AOL to give a good first impression.

Your title is based on what you know most right now: UX Designer or UI Designer works the best for almost everyone graduating. If you want to get more specific—UX Researcher, UX Researcher/Designer, Interaction Designer, Visual Designer, or something similar—that’s fine too, but your portfolio must reflect that specificity. If you can’t back up your title with your materials, you look like a weaker candidate.

## Summary

This is an optional section since most design resume do not have a summary but if you need additional content for your resume, this is a nice thing to have to set the stage. 

Think of your summary like an abbreviated elevator pitch. This is your opportunity to give the reader (in 3-4 sentences max) some insights into how you would apply your past experience to new opportunities, as well as insight into your motivations, passions, and interests. It also serves as information that the interviewer can use for conversation starters at your interview and provides some clues about your “cultural fit” with the company. 

When writing your summary, consider your audience. What do you want the person reading – most likely a recruiter, hiring manager, or future colleague – to know about you? What would be compelling to them about your background and experience? What is unique to you about your skills, projects, past experience (and what skills you will bring to a tech role), motivations for pursuing (or changing into) a career in tech, and/or passion for this field?

Write something out and then challenge yourself to go deeper. For example, “UX and UI designer with a passion for problem-solving seeking to make an impact through research and visual design.” What else can you say to make it more personal and factual? Can you provide more relevant details? How can you make a memorable impression?

>Product Designer with 3 years of experience in analytical research and user experience research. With expanded knowledge of digital user interface design, I am passionate about helping socially focused businesses with designing solutions from end to end.

Here are a couple of other examples.

>As a Digital User Interface Designer with historical experience in marketing, I strive for results-driven solutions by means of research, problem-solving and collaboration. Passionate about social change, I bring strong project management skills to any project.

>User Experience Designer and Researcher with a passion for finding a narrative in data and numbers. With an academic background and past experience in finance, I bring attention to detail and strong analytical skills to design projects that create an impact on society.

Remember, a strong resume summary is:

**Factually specific.** Include achievements and skills that you want to highlight for the reader, especially those listed in the job description as key qualifications. In addition, go into how your background and experience will contribute to what you hope to accomplish at jobs and companies. 

**Personal.** Let the reader in on who you are. Imagine they are reading dozens of these. Use your voice and your unique story to engage them and help them remember you among all the others.

**Customized.** While the summary you create for your resume should, in general, serve as an all-purpose summary across various job applications and interviews, there may be times where it makes sense to adjust it for particular applications. If a job description indicates a desire for a specific skill set that is currently not highlighted in your summary, that would be an ideal time to incorporate it. This helps in not only ensuring your resume’s relevance and appeal, but also can help significantly in search engine optimization and your resume’s visibility and/or ranking on job boards or company ATS’s (Applicant Tracking Systems).

Writing an impactful summary is and should be an iterative process like all things design. It’s often harder to write something short and concise, so start with writing in paragraph format and cover everything you would like to highlight and then spend time shortening it. 

**Experience**

Here is the basic structure for writing each experience:

1. Job or client
2. Dates of employment 
3. Your title at this job or project
4. Description of accomplishments or responsibilities 

Go in reverse chronological order, starting with your most recent job or client. This is the most useful section because it goes into the most detail about what you know, how you grow from job to job, and how your past experiences inform your current skills. 

Things to think about include: 

* Some detail of each job, client or even notable project
* Explanation of your responsibilities
* How you helped the business succeed
* How you developed skills, tools, or practices 

Your client project is part of your professional history, be it not paid, should be listed as the first and most recent work experience. List your position as UX Designer or UI Designer and the span of time the month you worked for that client. The rest of your time in this program should be listed as education.

**Dates**

For all jobs and projects, include the dates you began and ended them. The month and year are ideal. Be careful with only listing years since it may give the employer the wrong impression of how long you worked on a particular project for a client.

**Non-Design Related Experience**

For each experience, you have to indicate your primary responsibilities there, but remember to have them be reflective of your end goals of working at a design job. Play up the transferable skills and describe them the way a digital designer would: as stepping stones that helped get you where you are today. If you are unable to do that, it’s recommended to remove it, especially if you need the real estate space. Most times, showcasing you have worked for other industries doesn’t hurt as it shows you’ve been in the professional working world for a period of time. 

**Skills and Tools**

There is some overlap that can happen with Skills and Tools or if you prefer to combine them, that can work in addition to breaking them out.

**Skills** are areas of expertise in design you want to highlight from your current roster of topical knowledge. This may also include design adjacent skills worth letting prospective employers know you have experience in. Examples: Graphic design, web analytics, SEO, motion graphics, photography, brand strategy, copywriting. Do you know another language or skill worth outlining that may be relevant to design jobs?

**Tools** listing should be a list of the specific software programs you have experience working with.  If you have other tools that are digital design-adjacent that help show you’re a well-rounded professional, include them too. Don’t include software you barely know, unless you categorize it as software you’re actively improving  on right now.

Some employers like to understand the level of proficiency of software listed under Tools. If you chose to show this, it can be a simple rating by category (beginner/intermediate/advanced), or as a visual representation of your level for example: 7 out of 10 represented by horizontal color bars.

It’s recommended to order both these lists by most knowledgeable to least or by the most relevant to least relevant. Select whichever feels right for you. Here is a basic list for you to help get started; your list should be specific and more comprehensive to your skills in your specific field.

User Experience Skills

* Research
* Competitive Analysis
* Ideation
* Usability Testing
* Surveys
* Site Maps
* Personas
* Affinity Diagrams
* Wireframes
* Prototyping

User Interface Skills

* Branding
* User Interface Design
* Digital Interaction Design
* Desirability Testing
* High Fidelity Design 
* Mobile Design
* Design Systems
* Style Guides

Tools

* Sketch
* InVision
* Axure
* Adobe Photoshop
* Adobe Illustrator
* Google Suite
* Microsoft Suite

**Education**

This should be the smallest area of your resume. Simply put your educational experience. List out the educational entity and your time there noting month and year, and the degree earned. If it was a nontraditional educational program such as this one, simply leave out the degree earned. This can also include conferences or other upskilling courses you have taken and accomplished.

**Other Accomplishments**

This is a purely optional area but if you have the space for it, it’s nice to show some extracurricular accomplishments such as awards or group you are involved with. Do you volunteer in a design group or in the community? Are you a part of AIGA or part of setting up design events in your area? Any of these accomplishments demonstrate your well-rounded nature and gives further insight into who you are as a possible member of a team. 

**What Not To Include**

The following are items that can be left off a resume. 

* **Your mailing address.** Don’t give this information out anywhere online. If someone needs it—say, a hiring manager needs to mail you your written offer—you can provide it privately. Today, mailing addresses are not expected to be on resumes as they were in the past. 

* **A photo of yourself.** We’ve heard from hiring managers that photos can cause bias, either intentional or not. Save your self-portrait for LinkedIn and your portfolio “about” section.

* **Information about your references.** These are never needed in advance, and like your mailing address, companies will reach out to you privately for them when needed.

* **The objective.** Objectives have become not only limiting but also not as commonly leveraged by hiring managers anymore. Consider writing a professional summary or include some specifics in your cover letter. 

**The One Page Rule**

It’s best to keep resumes to one page. This may mean you may need to cut older experience entries that have nothing to do with design. This can be a great place to get rid of older jobs that aren’t as transferable to design. If taking them out can look like gaps in your employment history, try writing shorter summaries of your experiences that are not as relevant to design jobs or no description at all. Save the space for the most relevant experiences. At this point, get everything down and you can begin to trim and edit in the design phase of your resume. 

**Writing Tips**

Only use title case for proper nouns such as: 

* Official job titles
* Software names
* Cities/states/countries
* Movie/TV show/book titles
* Names of people

The everyday phrases of your design process are lowercase:

* heuristic evaluation
* design thinking
* visual designer
* journaling
* design principle

**Other general tips:**

* Remove “www.” and “http://“ from all URLs mentioned
* Be consistent with the listing and punctuation for all dates and bullets
* All items in your skills list are sentence case
* All items in your tools list are title case and checked for proper spelling and capitalization
* Remove all double spaces from the text
* Use active voice
* Use sentence case for all bullets and items except software names and proper nouns
